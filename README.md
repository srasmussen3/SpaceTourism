> This project uses HTML, CSS and JS to build a responsive and accessible mutipage space travel website. Its design is sourced from Frontend Mentor.

### Learning Scope:

- Creating and using a Design System including CSS resets.
- Using Utility classes for color and typography.
- Creating responsive multi-page layouts using CSS grid and Flexbox using a mobile first strategy.
- Checking color contrast for all text / icons.
- Designing effective buttons and 'dot' indicators for visual feedback.
- Being mindful of WCAG and striving for AA compliance. Some of them include:
  - Providing a unique title for each page
  - responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Using a simple and consistent layout.
  - semantic HTML
    - for example, using picture HTML tags instead of only image tags where necessary
    - making sure that all img elements have an 'alt' attribute / decorative ones use null values.
    - not skipping heading levels or using more than one h1 per page.
    - using list elements (ul, ol) for list content.
  - Ensuring links are recognizable as links.
  - Controls have ':focus' states
  - Provided a skip link
  - keyboard navigation
    - making sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input.
    <!-- - check to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout? -->
  - Including aria labels
    - ensuring instructions / roles arent visual only.
  - ensuring all animation obeys the 'prefers-reduced-motion' media query.
